This branch is patched from the Samsung source (2.6.32.9) for the SCH-I500
to 2.6.32.27

The kernel will build but will not boot. It appears that Samsung has
implemented a version check. Changing the EXTRAVERSION from .27 to .9 allows
the kernel to boot, but it starts boot looping. Any help in getting this to
work would be greatly appreciated.
